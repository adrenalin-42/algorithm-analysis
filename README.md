## Lab 1

Fibonacci number algorithm calculations. Here I compared 5 most popular algorithms:

1.  Naive recursive version
2.  Iterative version
3.  Formula based
4.  Recursion with dynamic programming techniques
5.  Matrix calculations

## Lab 2

Sorting algorithms calculations. I've compared 4 sorting algorithms:

1.  Quick sort algorithm
2.  Merge sort algorithm
3.  Heap sort algorithm
4.  Shell sort algorithm
